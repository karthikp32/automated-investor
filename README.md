Automated Investor

This project aims to solve one of my own problems through technology. I want a product that I can use to invest the money left over after expenses in different asset classes, such as Stocks, Real Estate, Cryptocurrencies, etc.. I want to invest my money in a way that will generate the largest amount of long-term returns.
Ex. 40% in Stocks, 30% in Real Estate, 30% in Crypto

KPIs
1. Customer Acquisition (Am I using this product?)
2. Customer Engagement (How often am I using this product?)
4. Loyalty (Would I use this product over another product?)

Theme
1. Acquire first customer (myself)

Brainstorm of new features, bugs, and tests to satisfy theme
1. See a projection of how much my money will return when put into each asset classes for given amount of time
Ex. With a $1000 and a time horizon of 40 years, I would see an exponential graph that shows how much my money would be worth if I invested that money in Stocks, Real Estate, or Crypto based on general rates of growth
2. Information about how I should diversify my money across Stocks, Real Estate, and Crypto based on risk and other factors
3. Information about the fundamentals of investing from legends like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger
4. An API that returns a projection about a house's value for a given amount of time from a model with 90% accuracy
5. A combination of specific stocks, real estate, and crypto to invest if given x amount of money
Ex. With $10000, I am recommended I should invest $8000 in a house in 83 S Cypress Ave, Columbus, OH, 43222, $1000 in Vanguard 500 index fund, $1000 in Ethereum
This recommendation is explained with rationale that includes why this house, index fund, and crypocurrencies are the right investment in comparison to the other deals available in the market. It explains why investing money in this combination is the best decision based on quantitative and qualitative assumptions.
