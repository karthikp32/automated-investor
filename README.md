Automated Investor

This project aims to solve one of my own problems through technology. I want a product that I can use to invest the money left over after expenses in different asset classes, such as Stocks, Real Estate, Cryptocurrencies, etc.. I want to invest my money in a way that will generate the largest amount of long-term returns.
Ex. 40% in Stocks, 30% in Real Estate, 30% in Crypto

KPIs
1. Customer Acquisition (Am I using this product?)
2. Customer Engagement (How often am I using this product?)
4. Loyalty (Would I use this product over another product?)

Theme
1. Acquire first customer (myself)

Brainstorm of new features, bugs, and tests to satisfy theme
1. See a projection of how much my money will return when put into each asset classes for given amount of time
Ex. With a $1000 and a time horizon of 40 years, I would see an exponential graph that shows how much my money would be worth if I invested that money in Stocks, Real Estate, or Crypto
2. Information about how I should diversify my money across Stocks, Real Estate, and Crypto based on risk and other factors
3. Information about the fundamentals of investing from legends like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger
